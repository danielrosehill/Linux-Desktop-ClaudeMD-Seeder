# CLAUDE.md For Cloned Projects Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains third-party projects and repositories that Daniel has cloned for reference, learning, or contribution purposes.

## Typical Contents

- Open source projects cloned for study or contribution
- Third-party libraries and frameworks
- Example projects and code samples
- Community projects of interest

## Common Tasks

When operating at this level of the filesystem, you may be asked to:

- Clone and organize third-party repositories
- Update cloned projects to latest versions
- Analyze code patterns and implementations
- Extract useful code snippets or patterns
- Maintain a clean collection by removing outdated clones
- Document interesting findings or implementations

## Best Practices

1. **Attribution**: Always maintain original repository information and credits
2. **Organization**: Consider organizing by technology, topic, or source
3. **Updates**: Periodically update cloned repos to stay current with upstream changes
4. **Documentation**: Document why specific projects were cloned and key learnings
5. **Cleanup**: Remove clones that are no longer needed to save space

## Working in This Directory

- Use `git pull` to update existing clones
- Check upstream changes before making local modifications
- Document any interesting patterns or implementations discovered
- Consider forking (to `~/repos/forks/`) if you plan to contribute
