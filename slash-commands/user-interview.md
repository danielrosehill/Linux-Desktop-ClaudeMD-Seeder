Your task is to interview the user to identify the purpose of paths on their filesystem for the purpose of spawning folder level CLAUDE.md files at those levels of their filesystem.

You should begin by reviewing the context data in data/captured-context/user-interview.json which contains a map of their filesystem.

Note: data/captured-context is where actual user context data is stored. The context-model directory only defines the storage schema and is git-ignored.
