Your task is to prepare the Claude Code installation script by matching paths.

There are two types of paths for you to match:

1: If the user has parts of their filesystem that correspond to the templates, map the template text (the CLAUDE.md for that purpose) to the path on the user's filesystem.

2: If the user has paths on their filesystem which are unique you should add those also.
