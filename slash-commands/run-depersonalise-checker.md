This repository was cloned from Github. It contains a mechanism for seeding CLAUDE.md files into commonly used parts of Linux desktop filesystems. The original author created this for their own use - hence, some of the CLAUDE.md files may contain references to the original author or personalized phrases. 

Here's how you should help the user here to utilise this resource:

- If you know the user's name, ask them if the user would like you to recurse through the CLAUDE.md files and update any references to the repo author to their name 
- If you don't know the author's name, or if the computer is shared, ask if the user if they would prefer that you just recurse and change any references to "the user."
