(For repo maintainer!)

This repository contains two folders for slash commands

These are:

./claude/commands

And:

slash-commands

The difference:

- The first is my library of slash commands to execute the tasks defined in the repo 
- The second is public and comprises an important part of the functionality of this repo (the install script copies it).

Your tasks:

1: Compare the two and keep the public version up to date by copying or recreating mising slash commands 

2: Depersonalisation: The public slash commands should not mention me (Daniel) or my system. If you can find any instances of personalisation, "white label" the public slash command library while keeping the local commands unmodified.
